**Objective:** Identify challenging technical leadership opportunity managing large scale data systems. 100% telecommute.

**Leadership:** For seven years in the early 2000s I managed 8-12 programmers and database/system
administrators in a mission critical OLTP database environment with multiple application stacks.
($400M revenue stream).
Daily management of operations while simultaneously managing high level expectations and
deliverables for senior management and ownership.

**Technical:** 30 years of programming / lead developer experience. Strong data modeling skills. Sustained focus
on the construction and maintenance of TCP/IP services (over "trusted" and untrusted networks).
Large-scale JSON / XML standards data processing and REST APIs exposing those.
Developed multi-site load balancing, high availability, and disaster recovery solutions; including
procedure definition, enforcement, and trials.
Strong focus on open source technologies. Passingly skilled with network design concepts.
I have championed documentation efforts for many companies.

**Dream Job:** Using my backend / database / programming skills to help with massively scaled providers of emergency /
low-income housing and food. The UNHCR (High Council on Refugees) and WFP (World Food Program)
are the largest examples of that mission I'm aware of. I'm very interested in logistics.
The highest calling I can imagine is working on empowering thousands / millions of deliveries
of food / clothing / shelter.

## Experience

### Senior Software Engineer | Infinity Interactive | 2011-2025

Telecommuting consultant. Python, Perl, Golang, PL/pgSQL, large scale databases, REST APIs, minor web.
Industries have included bioinformatics, AI (LLM) start-ups, advertising technology, large event / venue
equipment rental (and data mining thereof), e-commerce (web retail), and various other start-ups.

In principle recent clients have a lot of DevOps in-house so I can focus on
programming software stacks (Python, Perl, Golang, Javascript).
In practice I've been doing a lot of DevOps filling gaps in staffing.

My most recent DevOps work has been Python -> Terraform -> AWS (ECS, EC2, S3, Lambdas, CloudWatch, etc.)
Previous clients have swung back and forth between micro-service strategies and in-house bare-metal:
Xen VMs, Kubernetes.
Those stacks have been variously driven by Docker/Compose, Chef/Ansible, Helm Charts, and other tools.

### Senior Software Engineer | -NDA- | 2024-2025 (6 months)

Python development and DevOps for a bioinformatics company (industry leading DNA foundry).
30K lines of Python, deployed to AWS (ECS, EC2, S3, Lambdas, CloudWatch, etc.)
via 37K lines of Terraform config. Writing / improving Python, Dockerfile,
and Terraform configurations to enable automated cloud processing of their complex
scientific data pipelines from multiple data sources through to customer delivery.
Monitoring, reporting on progress / status, error handling.

### Senior Software Engineer | -NDA- | 2023-2024 (4 months)

AI (LLM) start-up client further developing their Python (FastAPI) REST API stack (deployed via Google Cloud Run),
and their Google FireStore (FireBase) NoSQL schema, expanding their feature set.
Established Pytest CI regime, added/refactored many REST endpoints.
Bridged them to also use PostgreSQL ("Cloud SQL") when FireBase statistical capacities proved massively
inefficient (slow) for multiple business org and timeframe roll-ups. 

### Senior Software Engineer | MediaMath Inc. ($170M) | 2014-2023

Worked as staff augmentation consultant for REST API team and associated services. The company employed ~140
engineers. Our primary mission was to design, maintain, and enhance a PostgreSQL schema and REST APIs for
modifying data in that schema, primarily for configuration of advertising campaigns.

**Primary PostgreSQL:** 273 tables, 75 views, 234 functions (mostly PL/pgSQL). ~500GB, 80M rows

**API v3 stack:** Golang 1.20.5, gin 1.9.1 web framework. 67K lines of tests, 116K total lines of code. Stack
built locally (development) via Docker Compose (DB and application). IDE: Visual Studio Code plus custom
linting rules (revive). Continuous integration via CircleCI. If tests all pass, topic branches deployed
automatically to in-house Kubernetes cluster for both QA and PROD. Fully automated continuous delivery via
Helm Charts. Prometheus integration for statistics. Production alerting via PagerDuty. Log aggregation via
SumoLogic, including Sumologic Traces (in-app OpenTelemetry hooks).

**API v2 stack:** Perl 5.30.1, Catalyst 5.90128 web framework. 98K lines of tests, 232K total lines of code. Stack
built locally (development) via Docker Compose (DB and applications (main API and ancillary applications)).
IDE: Whatever the developer prefers. Visual Studio Code and vim were both common. Continuous integration via
Jenkins, which also served as our "continuous delivery" mechanism to pre-allocated in-house clusters of QA
servers (18 sets). Production deployment automated and integrated into Slack, sending status updates for ~15
different phases of production rollout. All hardware pre-allocated, dedicated (not dynamic). statsd
integration for statistics. Production alerting via PagerDuty. Log aggregation via SumoLogic. No
OpenTelemetry.

**core-serializer:** Perl 5.34.0, Python3 (Dockerfile "latest"). 12K lines of tests, 17K total lines of code.
Stack built locally (DEV and QA) via Docker Compose (DB and application). Continuous integration and delivery
via CircleCI. If tests all pass, production deployed automatically via Chef recipe updates and published via
in-house Chef Manage server (chef-client on dedicated hardware).

In 2020 Golang was chosen as an API v2 replacement (Perl), API v3 expansion
began in earnest. We re-implemented core functions, driven by next-generation
UI layer requirements. I coordinated with product owners and stakeholders as
needed to design and deliver those solutions. I wrote reams of documentation
for those systems, with countless diagrams. I emphasized solving problems once
since our historical one-off ad-hoc solutions continued to be inconsistent and
extremely expensive (time, resource consuming) over years and multiple
generations of product, leadership, and engineering staff.

The APIs also serve as orchestration layers, back-ending requests to other services (APIs and others). We
spent lots of time and effort developing and maintaining integrations to those systems, hosted by other
MediaMath departments, and many third party vendors.

For three years the company went through an AWS microservices phase. We split large chunks of the above DB and
APIs out into AWS EC2, RDS, ECS, and a dozen other AWS services. Eventually AWS proved too expensive
($3M/month), and several of those microservices were re-absorbed back into the above services. I designed,
developed, and tore-down services on both sides of those transitions.

I served as an informal part-time trainer / mentor for several new hires. I upgraded thousands of lines of
abandoned (yet business critical) Python2 into Python3 and modernized that software stack. I proposed
high-level overhauls of systems that were causing long-running inefficiencies in business operations.

### Software Architect / Director of Development | Omni Hotels ($720M) | 1999-2010

* Design, manage, implement, and document complex software/data systems to fulfill the stated technology goals
of the senior management team. Provide regular status updates and cost estimates.
* Until 2004, managed all daily operations for central reservations call center and data center, a $400M revenue
stream. In 2004, hired an IT Manager to manage daily operations to allow more focus on high-level development.
* In tandem with Software Architect, implemented custom Internet booking engine (www.omnihotels.com), saving
the company $140M a year in commissions (Linux, Apache, OO Perl 5, mod_ssl, mod_perl, Linux based load
balancing and high availability).

all database I/O (central reservation system is 300 tables in monolithic RDBMS install), centralizing disparate
business controls into single, consistent framework.
* Replacing numerous inconsistent system interfaces with single OpenTravel Alliance (hospitality / travel industry
standards body) XML specification to ensure data integrity and consistent application of business rules. In this
design, all data exchange inside and outside the company will be served by a single highly available and load
balanced cluster of low-cost Linux servers running a single application framework enforcing all business rules.
* First hired to replace a primarily one-man development team who was departing and a series of consultants.
* Established documentation systems, version control, operating procedures, monitoring and paging, and
departmental cross training.

### Application Support / Development Specialist | University of Nebraska Medical Center | 2007-2010

(PKI) of the University of Nebraska, Omaha (UNO).
* In one project I wrote a bunch of Perl, deployed it to UNO's super computer cluster, crunched a ton of data, and that work ended
up being useful enough to the scientists that I was listed as a co-author on a scientific paper. Don't ask me to
explain the science (my biology / chemistry is weak) but I can try to remember a vague outline of the software I
wrote if you're interested:

  <p>Mother's gone and we're so lonely</p>
  <p>Mother- sweetest name e'er spoke.</p>
  <p>In her love our hearts found shelter,</p>
  <p>When life's storms and tempest broke.</p>
  <p>Mother's gone, the Master called her,</p>
  <p>He who died her soul to save.</p>
  <p>And she's gone in triumph homeward.</p>
  <p>Tho' her pathway's through the grave.</p>

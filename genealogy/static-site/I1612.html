  <h2>Notes</h2>

  <p>"Marie" was a twin, the other baby died at birth. Marie weighed 2 or 21/2 lbs. Dr. didn't think she would live. Margaret Byers insisted theykeep her warm and put her in a shoe box and fed her with an eye dropper.She grew into a fine healthy girl. Then typhoid came along and she neverrecovered from it. She was probably born at Tama, Iowa also.</p>

  <p>Milton Knight worked for the railroad on the section in Tama. Latertheymoved and rented a farm from people named "Apple" about 5 miles fromMalcolm. Margaret spoke of Booklin so it must have been between Malcolm&amp; Brooklin. They moved by train from there to Memphis, Mo. Years laterto Charleston, Iowa where they both died.</p>

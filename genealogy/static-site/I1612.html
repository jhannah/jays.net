  <p>"Marie" was a twin, the other baby died at birth. Marie weighed 2 or 21/2 lbs. Dr. didn't think she would live. Margaret Byers insisted theykeep her warm and put her in a shoe box and fed her with an eye dropper.She grewinto a fine healthy girl. Then typhoid came along and she neverrecovered from it. She was probably born at Tama, Iowa also.</p>

  <p>EARL C. HUMPHREY</p>

  <p>Earl C. the oldest son of James T. and Gertrude Humphrey, was born nearSalem September 4th, in the year 1891, and died in Deming, New Mexicoafter an illness of three weeks of pneumonia, January 2nd, 1918, aged 26years, 3 months and 28 days.</p>

  <p>Earl grew to manhood in the community where he was born and the home ofhis parents, where he developed the noble principles of manhood and waseverything in the home that parents could ask or expect of a son.</p>

  <p>He was a manly fellow- honest, industrious, brave and fearless, buttender and kind. It was said of him that it was impossible to findanything in his life to cause anyone to dislike him, and when you met himhe compelled admiration.</p>

  <p>In the summer of 1917 he responded cheerfully to the call of hiscountry and entered the military service, where he gave up his life thatour nation might be saved form the oppression of an unscrupulous tyrant.</p>

  <p>When the news of his serious illness came his father immediately wentto him. Everything that could be done was done for him, but no humanpower could save him and God took him. He wanted to live, saying, "Ihave so much to live for, and I want to return and see all my friends inIowa."</p>

  <p>The father tells in the highest terms of praise of the kind andgenerous treatment his son and he received at the hands of officers andcomrades in the camp during the two weeks he was there.</p>

  <p>A very generous contribution was made by his comrades with which topurchase flowers. The remains were taken to the railroad station by amilitary escort, while the accompanying band rendered inspiring andtenderest music.</p>

  <p>The name of Earl C. Humphrey will never be forgotten in the communitywhere he lived, but will ever be green in the memory of all the peoplewhile the years roll on.</p>

  <p>His funeral was conducted from the Round Prairie Baptist church byRev.A .w. Miller, January 8th, at 11 a.m., in the presence of a very largecongregation, where strong men and boys mingled their tears and sobswiththose of tender women and girls.</p>

  <p>He is survived by his father, one brother Bert L. of Salem, and onesister, Anna C. Humphrey of Fairfield.</p>

  <p>His mother preceded him in death several years ago. - Contributed.</p>

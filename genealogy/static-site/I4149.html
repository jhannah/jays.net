  <h2>Notes</h2>

  <p>&acirc;&euro;"Compiled by James Bradley Hannah, 19 APRIL 2023 and updated 7 MAY 2024.</p>

  <p>Thomas and Elizabeth are buried in Buckingham Friends Cemetery, Buckingham, Bucks County, Pennsylvania. They had six children.</p>

  <p>In 1763 Thomas brought his wife and six children to America with the congregation of the Presbyterian Church of Ballybay,* Ireland, of which they were members. They landed at New Castle, Delaware, British Colonial America, where their eldest son, John, died after the ship cast anchor. The surviving children were James, Robert, Hugh, Martha, and Thomas. The family settled among Quakers in Buckingham, Bucks County, Pennsylvania. (SOURCES RoootsWeb.com and A History of the Hanna Family, Charles Rice, pp.12-14)</p>

  <p>(Since Thomas and Elizabeth were buried in a Friends cemetery, they likely converted from the Presbyterian Church to the Society of Friends (Quakers). Three generations later their progeny migrated to the Quaker village of Salem, Iowa.)</p>

  <p>* The Ballybay congregation in 1751 dissented from the Irish Presbytery of Monoghan to join the Scottish Presbytery of Glasgow. Thomas and his brother Robert signed the secessionist papers. The entire congregation came to America. Those not coming in 1763 to New Castle came to New York in 1764.) SOURCE: rootweb.com, research by Chris Kraft</p>

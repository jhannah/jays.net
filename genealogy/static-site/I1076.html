  <h2>Notes</h2>

  <p>29 JUN 2025:</p>

  <p>Jay Weston Hannah (James' son) was asking James (Jim (Dad)) about our Quaker ancestry and the following exchange occurred via text messages:</p>

  <p>James: I think you know that your great-great-grandpa John Long was a Quaker "administrator" (they had only lay ministers, no paid clergy) in the Salem area. Mom never talked about how the family transitioned to Methodism. Ironically, this "peace church" in Salem became divided overly the issue of slavery in earlier generations, forming separate abolitionist and pro-slavery meeting houses, even separate cemeteries. Perhaps that somehow soured the family on Quakerism? John Long was part of the selection committee that chose the site of the current Salem Quaker Church, where I've attended funeral services for the Cammack family. I imagine they have records there that could ID any other Long family adherents in the Society of Friends. I'm not aware of any. Mom's siblings were Methodist, Baptist, Seventh Day Adventist, and "nones."</p>

  <p>Jay: It would be interesting (Hannah or Long) to trace coming to America to becoming Quaker to ... still / no longer Quaker. I might have living Quaker Hannahs or Long cousins?</p>

  <p>James: On the Hannah side, Thomas came here from Ireland as a Scottish Presbyterian and was buried with his wife in a Quaker cemetery in Pennsylvania. I'm thinking the next generation migrated to the Quaker settlement of Salem, Iowa, where the Longs had also migrated. But by the time the Longs and Hannahs intermarried (my mom and dad) both families had become Methodist. There may have been others in either family that remained Quaker, but not to my knowledge.</p>

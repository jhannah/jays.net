M. ARMER<br>The Des Moines Register of May 22nd, under caption of &quot;Simple and JovialLive Responsible for 93 Years,&#39; and with photographs of Mr. and Mrs.Armer, contains the following tribute to our esteemed townsman:<br>&quot;James Armer, 93, attributes his longevity to the &#39;simple life&#39; andfriends add, &#39;a jovial one.&#39;<br>&quot;He was born at Johnstown, Pa., March 29, 1832. He took work on acanal boat as a drive of horses when 13 and at the end of four yearshada record of never having been lashed by his master. Apprenticed to amillwright he followedthat trade many years. Enroute to Iowa in 1864 heand his wife witnessed the battle of Paducah, Ky.<br>&quot;He has been farmer and justice of the peace. &#39;The only time I waseverarrested,&#39; he says with a twinkle of the eye, &#39;was for trotting a team onthe streets of Johnstown, which was contrary to the city ordinance.&#39;Ableto walk a fewblocks and attend to his own business matters, &#39;Squire&#39;Armer awaits the &#39;call of the evening bell.&#39;&quot; The Salem Weekly News April 15, 1926<br>OBITUARY<br>James McCurdy Armer was born near Johnston, Indiana Co., Penna., March29, 1832, and passed away at his home in Salem, Ia., April 10, 1926,aged94 years and 11 days.<br>He was the son of Robert and Isabelle McCurdy Armer, and was one of afamily of twelve children, only one now remaining, Mrs. Margaret Bower ofIndianapolis, Ind.<br>October 7, 1856 he was united in marriage to Maria Gamble of Johnstown,Pa., where they resided for seven years, then removing to Mt. Pleasant,Iowa in 1864, where they remained for eight years.<br>Mr. Armer was a millwright and for a number of years followed thisoccupation, later he took up farming, purchased a farm in Jackson twp.where he with his family were residents for 35 years, following theretirement from which activefarm life, Mr. and Mrs. Armer moved to Salemwhere the latter passed away April 10, 1923, preceding her husband to thegreat beyond, three years. This seems a remarkable coincidence, husbandand wife passing away on the same date,only a period of three shortyears, intervening. James and Maria Armer enjoyed many of life&#39;sblessings, one of the greatest of these being that of traveling life&#39;spathway together a period of more than 67 years. In 1906 theycelebratedtheir 50th wedding anniversary, and October 7th 1921, their 65thanniversary was passed quietly in their home with the members of theirimmediate family.<br>To this union were born nine children - Bruce Armer, Salem, Ia. Mrs.Mary Goldsmith, Salem; Mrs. Ellen Long, Salem; Miss Laura Armer, Salem;Mrs. Etta Harshbarger, Mt. Pleasant; four having passed to the greatbeyond, James Worth andSusan Francis passing away in infancy, GeorgeArmer in 1903, and Alda Armer Wright in 1921; a number of grandchildrenand great grand children are also left to mourn.<br>Mr. Armer was a man loved and respected by all who knew him, was agreat reader and real student of nature and history, and his wonderfulmemory enabled him to retain much; he was an earnest christian and churchworker, was a member ofthe Methodist church for overly 50 years, one ofhis favorite church papers being the Christian Advocate of which he hadbeen a continual subscriber for 50 years; he was a true friend andneighbor, and when we think of his long usefullife, covering a period ofmore than fourscore years and ten, we think of it as an example,typifying real truth and honor, and it may be truthfully said, &quot;I havefought the good fight, I kept the faith, I have finished mycourse,enter now into the joy of thy Lord.&quot;<br>Funeral services were conducted Monday, April 12 at 2:30, from theMethodist church in Salem, by Rev. Thomas Pool, a former pastor andlife-long friend of the deceased, assisted by Rev. F. A. Wilder and Rev.Bishop.

Of this union ten children were born, ninesurvive him, all of whom have families. He leaves, besides wife andchildren a large number of grand and great grand children, most of whomreside in Rooks county. He was converted when about forty years of ageand joined the Friends church. He was one among the first to break awayfrom the old isms of the church and step out in the real liberty of thegospel. In October 1878 he, with his entire family, came to Rooks countywhere he took up a claim which he lived on till his death. Through hisearnest efforts there was a Sabbath school organized and soon churchservices were held. He was very benevolent and seeing the need of alarge building to gather the children for religious teaching he undertookthe erection of a building and by his untiring efforts he Friends churchwas built, being the first church building in this part of Rooks county.The school, which he was the means of organizing, known all overly thecounty as "Union Headlight," is still held and when he was able he wassure to be one of the number gathered there. He has spent a long anduseful life and will be missed by everybody as was shown by the longprocession that followed his remains to the last resting place in Shilohcemetery.</p>

  <h2>Notes</h2>

  <p>[We have a spelling conflict here. John Hannah's obit and the CatherineJ. Hannah obit lists the spelling as "Seton", yet all referencesfor Catherine's father Ebenezer and childrenspell the name "Seaton". Not knowingwhich obits to believe I'll leave Catherine spelled differently fromthe rest of her family. -Jay Weston Hannah Nov 26 2005]</p>

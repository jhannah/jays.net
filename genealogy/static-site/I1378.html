  <p>STEAM BOILER EXPLOSION</p>

  <p>Two Men Killed and Four Others</p>

  <p>Seriously Injured</p>

  <p>The boiler in the saw mill of Lucius Ball, situated a few milessouthwest of Dodgeville in this county, about twelve miles from thiscity, exploded yesterday afternoon with a terrific report, and resultedin the complete destruction of boiler mill and engine. The boiler wastorn in fragments and scattered far around the previous site of the mill;the logs and shed were so cleaned out that the spot now looks as thoughthere never had been a mill or shed at that place. Six persons wereseverely scalded and bruised by the accident, the injuries to two ofthembeing fatal. The fatally injured were B. F. Byers, the sawyer, a manabout thirty years of age, and the engineer, Wint Calloway, about twentyone years old. A young man named Carl is hurt very badly and two mennamed Hayes have received some severe wounds but are not considereddangerous. John Reed was engaged in loading railroad ties in the yardwhen the explosion occurred. He was struck on the head by the debris andscalded by the escaping steam, and lay senseless for a long time. Histeam as well as himself was nearly covered with the mud and debris.</p>

  <p>As soon as possible the sufferers were given all assistance possible.Dr. Barclay, of Dodgeville, and a doctor from Pleasant Grove wereattending to the wants of the victims. The sufferings of the injured menwere amore than the strongest man could face. A more complete disasterthan the destruction of the mill was never recorded.</p>

  <p>We are indebted to Mr. J. M. Sperry for the news of the above disaster.</p>

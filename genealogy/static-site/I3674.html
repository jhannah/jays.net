  <p>In a special to the Hawk-Eye from Mt. Pleasant the following is gleanedfrom the testimony of Bert McDowell and from a conversation with ClaytonHockett, the murderer of Albert McDowell: It was between 8 and 9 o'clockand gettingdark. McDowell was the first to speak, and he demanded ofHockett what he wanted. Hockett replied: "I want to settle this fuss.""Well, I reckon it's a good night," replied McDowell. And to this retortHockett demanded that theyrepair to the public highway and fight itout. McDowell declined and ordered Hockett off. McDowell startedtowards Hockett. Hockett himself claims McDowell had a club, shows markson his chin and face, where he alleges he was hit. A club, a piece ofsingle-tree, according to Hockett, was also found near by, which hadbeenthere but a short time. Bert however says his uncle had nothing in hishands. As McDowell approached Hockett drew back and finally drewarevolver and fired. He missed as he says, purposely. McDowell keptfollowing Hockett up and clinched him. The struggle must have beenterrific. McDowell was fighting for the possession of the pistol and forhis life. During theclinch Hockett fired again and McDowell fell to hisknees, but immediately regained his feet and put after Hockett again, whowas backing off. He had gotten within ten feet of Hockett when thelatter shot again with effect. McDowell staggered a few steps and fell.Hockett ran to his horse and galloped off. Bert McDowell rushed to hisuncle and asked him if he was badly hurt. He replied that he was, and inthe heart. Bert asked him if he wanted water,but he never answered.Dick Karr and John McDowell, who were near by, hastened to the sceneandcarried the body of McDowell to the house. He was then dead. Hockettstopped in his flight and told his brother, M. S. Hockett, andthefollowing conversation was had, according to evidence before thecoroner's jury: "Did you do that shooting?" Clayton replied, "I did.""What did you do it for?" his brother asked. "I don't know," repliedClayton, bursting intotears, "I am afraid I have killed him, I wishhehad killed me."</p>

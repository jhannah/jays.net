  <p>The cause to the fatal deed grew out of a dispute in which a certainyoung lady with whom McDowell was keeping company, informed him thatshehad been insulted by Hockett on the evening of the 18th, inst. at adance held at Edgar Scott's. On last Sunday night the two young menmetand disputed the statement, when Hockett stated that he would have it outwith him. Tuesday evening he went to the home of McDowell and met hisvictim in the barnyard, when a few words were exchanged and Hockett drewa 32 - caliber revolver and shot at McDowell three times, two shotstaking effect, one in the lower part of the breast and the other close tothe armpit. McDowell fell and died almost instantly. Hockett then wentto his father and reported the act, and said he wanted to give himself upto the officers and requested his father to drive him to Mt. Pleasant,which was done. McDowell was a young man of 32 years. Thus ends anotherdark chapter in Henry county's history.</p>

  <p>In a special to the Hawk-Eye from Mt. Pleasant the following is gleanedfrom the testimony of Bert McDowell and from a conversation with ClaytonHockett, the murderer of Albert McDowell: It was between 8 and 9 o'clockand getting dark. McDowell was the first to speak, and he demanded ofHockett what he wanted. Hockett replied: "I want to settle this fuss.""Well, I reckon it's a good night," replied McDowell. And to this retortHockett demanded that they repair to the public highway and fight itout. McDowell declined and ordered Hockett off. McDowell startedtowards Hockett. Hockett himself claims McDowell had a club, shows markson his chin and face, where he alleges he was hit. A club, a piece ofsingle-tree, according to Hockett, was also found near by, which hadbeenthere but a short time. Bert however says his uncle had nothing in hishands. As McDowell approached Hockett drew back and finally drew arevolver and fired. He missed as he says, purposely. McDowell keptfollowing Hockett up and clinched him. The struggle must have beenterrific. McDowell was fighting for the possession of the pistol and forhis life. During the clinch Hockett fired again and McDowell fell to hisknees, but immediately regained his feet and put after Hockett again, whowas backing off. He had gotten within ten feet of Hockett when thelatter shot again with effect. McDowell staggered a few steps and fell.Hockett ran to his horse and galloped off. Bert McDowell rushed to hisuncle and asked him if he was badly hurt. He replied that he was, and inthe heart. Bert asked him if he wanted water, but he never answered.Dick Karr and John McDowell, who were near by, hastened to the sceneandcarried the body of McDowell to the house. He was then dead. Hockettstopped in his flight and told his brother, M. S. Hockett, and thefollowing conversation was had, according to evidence before thecoroner's jury: "Did you do that shooting?" Clayton replied, "I did.""What did you do it for?" his brother asked. "I don't know," repliedClayton, bursting into tears, "I am afraid I have killed him, I wishhehad killed me."</p>

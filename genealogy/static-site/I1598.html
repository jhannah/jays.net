  <p>HANNAH R. HAMILTON</p>

  <p>Hannah Rosetta Hamilton was born in Plainfield, Ind., Dec. 22, 1833. Shewith her family emigrated from her native home to Iowa, before it becamea state. At 22 years of age she was united in marriage, near AckworthIowa, to George Hamilton. To this union there were given five children:four sons, James, John, Charles, and Elmer, and one daughter, Mrs. EvaVining. They moved from Iowa to Kansas 41 years ago. Coming to hisstate at that early period necessitated a continuation of the hard timesthat all of the early settlers had to undergo. The hard times offrontier life did not discourage nor harden her spirits, but softened andsweetened her character. She was reared a Quaker, but after coming towomanhood she was baptized and joined the Baptist church, in which churchshe remained a member for 53 years. Her transfer came January 30, whenGod called her from the church militant to the church triumphant tobewith himself. Mrs. Hamilton's maiden name was Bunker. Her father wasone of the laborers who was employed in excavating the Erie canal. Hebegan work on the canal the first day and continued his work with thecompany, and continued his work until the completion of the canal,receiving advanced wages for every day, during the entire time takentocomplete the canal, for his total abstinence from liquor. Mrs. Hamilton's great grandfather owned the farm upon which was fought the famousbattle of Bunker Hill. The last 20 years of her life was spent in thehome of her daughter Mrs. Eve Vining. Her last sickness was for a fewdays only, being caused by a fall in which one of her bones was broken.Her three sisters from out of town and her own children were all presentat the funeral, which was held from the Methodist church, conducted bythe pastor. a By request the choir sang as the closing hymn, "BeautifulBeckoning Hands.' Interment was made in the city cemetery.- Horton (Kas.)Headlight Commercial.</p>

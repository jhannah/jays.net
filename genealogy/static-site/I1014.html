  <h2>Notes</h2>
  <p>Salem News Feb. 27, 1913<br>
  MRS. WEEKS WRITES AGAIN<br>
  ED NEWS: - Since reading Levi Gregory's last letter I think I oughtto say that "Jinny Bob" was John Taylor of Charleston, Ia. that I livedby him as a neighbor, and that they were a nice family; the wife wasconfined to her bed forseveral years and he had a hard time.<br>
  Mr. Gregory was right about the curtain factory but I am right on theother one, that is, the shop never was on the spot that the Weeks housestands on; it was near it.<br>
  I think Mrs. McQuay's story was fine. I will tell you how a parrot waslost and found south of Salem, the story was told me by Rachel Bunker.Her father was riding through the woods when he heard a voice say"Father! Father!" andlooked all around to see if a child was lost. Itrepeated the words and he looked up, as it sounded above him, and therewas the parrot. He coaxed it to him and took it home with him, and thereare those living that can tell you moreabout it than I can. I hopethatRachel Collins will tell how long it lived and some of its cute sayings.<br>
  Yes, the News is alright and I for one like the present managementbetter than any we ever had in Salem, and I think we ought to say thepleasant things before, not after people are dead. I like the lettersbest of all in the News,except the locals.<br>

  <p>Obituary</p>

  <p>GIBSON - At her father's home in Salem, Iowa, March 8, 1892. Mary E.Gibson, aged 29 years and 9 months. Burial at the Friend's Cemetery.</p>

  <p>The many friends of this estimable and saintly young lady would besaddened when they heard of her death, which occurred on the morningofMarch 8th. She was the only daughter of Isaac T. and Anna M. Gibson, ofSalem, Henry County.</p>

  <p>Mary Elma Gibson was born June 9, 1862 in the same room wherein shefell asleep in Jesus. She had always enjoyed excellent health untilabout four years ago. She was converted when about thirteen years ofage, and has grown up as a consistent member of the Society of Friends.The life was beloved by all who knew her, because it was so beautiful, sopure and Christian like. Her cultured refined, and graceful bearinginher daily walks of life, will be remembered by all with whom she came incontact. That loving, beautiful life which had woven itself into noblewomanhood at the age of thirty years, underneath the fostering care ofloving parents, lays it down again without a murmur to Him who gave itand had redeemed it with His won blood when it had served the purpose forwhich it had been given. She saw the wisdom of God's divine dealings,and acknowledged the infinite wisdom that had directed her unevenfootsteps in the following language "If these walls could only speaktheycould tell better than I of those long dreary days I have spent insolitude and darkness, yet I think it was the greatest blessing of mylife when my sight was taken from me. I did not think so then but Idonow. Her life closed triumphantly with mind unimpaired, and a faithintensified by the near approach of scenes within the wall. She passedthe latter portion of her life preparing for the change that wasgradually coming on apace. She left behind her many testimonies andrequests full of wonderful meaning and pathos. She was more thanwilling to give up her life to Him who had redeemed the same for ahigher, nobler sphere in the spiritual world beyond.</p>

  <p>The funeral services were conducted according to her own request byRev. Davies, at the Friends church where a large sympathizing audiencegathered to participate in the solemn and impressive service. The Rev.Davies was followed by an address by Rev. W. G. Thorne, of Mt. Pleasant.His words were elevating and inspiring worthy the occasion, they couldnot fail to inspire the hope and strengthen those hearts that had beentouched by this sore berevement. Rev. Levi Gregory offered prayer.</p>

  <p>The remains were laid to rest almost underneath the shadow of thechurch she has been connected with from childhood. Dear Mary, to thineimmortal memory my pen would inscribe ovder thy tomb the language ofone,.</p>

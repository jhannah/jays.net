  <h2>Notes</h2>

  <p>Here are two pictures that I have,in the first one Mary Schlief Sessleris on the far left, Nellie is in the middle left then Bertha is in themiddle right,and Lizzie is on the far right</p>

  <p>In the second picture Lizzie is on the left Mary is in the middle andHiram is on the right.</p>

  <p>I blew up the pictures a little so they might show up kind of boxy but Iwanted to make sure you could see them well.</p>

  <p>Mary Sessler Had two sons as well as Bertha they were George M. (b 1890in Iowa) and Carl Herman (b 1894). George married Ruth M.( I dont knowher last name , I gotten this from a census ) and they had a son George E.(b 1928 in Texas).</p>

  <p>Bertha Sessler Riley had 4 children John Jay (7/31/1920 in Fairfield)Mary(b 1925 in Iowa (probably Fairfield but I gotten that from a censustoo)) Frances (b 1928 in Fairfield ) and Andrew. John J. married MarjorieEleanor Mack in the 1940s not exactly sure what year and they had adaughter Marjorie E. Jr and 2 months later his wife died of cancer. Heremarried to Blanche McDonald and had 3 more kids John Jay Jr 1952, David(still born), and Barbara Ann 1956. Frances married John Charles Lutherand they have 3 children but I cant remember thier names I have to lookthem up Frances and her husband are still living in Waukon Iowa She iswhere I gotten all of the pictures and info from. Knowone knows whathappened to Mary or if she is even still alive. And Andrew died when hewas very young.</p>

  <p>I havent been able to go back any farther then Samuel and Katherine,Hoffman is such a common name which makes it difficult to get anywhere.</p>

  <p>I hope that I have been able to help you AngelonIce@@nc.rr.com.</p>

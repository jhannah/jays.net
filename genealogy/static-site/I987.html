  <p>Robt. F. Hannah for Sheriff.</p>

  <p>Some of the neighbors of Robert F. Hannah of Jackson township havebeenasking him to come out for sheriff on the Democratic ticket. KnowingRobert Hannah as well as we do, we can see why his neighbors are urginghim to make the race. He is a splendid democrat, would be well qualifiedand can be elected. Of course ,we don't know what Sheriff Kauffman wouldsay to this. He has not said that he would run again, neither has hesaid that he would stand in the way of a worthy Democrat. In fact, hesaid to this writer some time ago that he was not anxious to run forthethird term, especially if there was some good Democrat to run instead.</p>

  <p>All we can say is that if Robt. Hannah runs, we will have a splendidcandidate and if Kauffman doesn't' run, we would be glad to do whatlittle we can do to aid Hannah. As we have said before Kauffman is avote getter and if he wants to run for a third term we are not one to saythat he shouldn't have the chance. There is some prejudice against thirdterms in this county and it is a thing to be considered, however,Kauffman is a good politician, and he no doubt will give this carefulconsideration if he has not already done so.</p>

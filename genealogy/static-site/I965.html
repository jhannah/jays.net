To them were born six children , viz: Florence Jenette, Anna Verginia, Robert Wayne, Ruth Angeline, Marcia Emeline and Benjamin Millard, all surviving the father.</p>

  <p>Mr. Hannah was a very energetic farmer, public spirited and fervent in community interests; he was strong and robust, an untiring worker, a good fellow, which won for him a wide acquaintance and friendship. He was a faithful husband, a loving father and an obedient son.</p>

  <p>During the revival meeting conducted by Rev. B.G. Hankins, John gave his heart to God, and united with the M.E. [Methodist Episcopal] church at Donaldson chapel. He was elected Supt. of the Sunday School, in that place became active in that and various other church enterprises.</p>

He leaves a companion, six children, a father, Frank Hannah [Benjamin Franklin], a brother, Raymond, a sister, Mrs. Anna Hunting, an aged grandmother, other relatives and a host of friends to mourn their loss.</p>

  <p>Funeral services were conducted at Donaldson chapel, the church being too small to accommodate the people who came to show respect and honor for him. Rev. James, assisted by Rev. Pool conducted the services.Interment was in the Friends cemetery at Salem.</p>

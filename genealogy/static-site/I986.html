  <h2>Notes</h2>

  <p>Viola S. Courter and John W. Hannah were united in Holy Matrimony atan8:00 P.M. ceremony on July 2, 1891 at the Methodist parsonage in Salem ,Ia. by the Rev. Tomas S. Pool. Reverend Pool's daughter played the organand his young son, Robert D. who as blind played the violin.</p>

  <p>In 1897 they bought their first farm land which was located near theHannah homestead. Part of this farm was in timber. There was no house,just a barn. John W. with the help of his oldest brother , Frank, andthe loving care of his wife, Viola, cut the trees and had them made intologs and cordwood for fuel. From the logs they built a one-room logcabin.</p>

  <p>Everyone called Viola by the nickname of "Birdie". Her mother had givenViola that name when she was a young girl because she was always singing,whistling, and imitating birds. Viola loved nature. ;Viola's father(Peter Courter) was the only one who called her Viola.</p>

  <p>John W. was always known as John W. or "Honest John". His father's namewas John. John W. also had a nephew by the name of John R. It wasnecessary to say "John W." so that others would know which John you werespeaking about.</p>

  <p>John and Viola's only son, Harold, was born in the log cabin. . He livedonly a few hours. Birdie sewed a little white dress by hand to lay himaway in. He was buried under an arch of lilacs in the northeast cornerin his grandfather Hannah's front yard. Later two little blue -eyedgirls were born in this log cabin. One of these little girls, Belle,only weighed 2 1/2 pounds, mighty tiny and delicate. Through faith andgood care her parents, with the help of her 3 older sisters , raisedherthrough those very anxious days and months. Esther Ruth was born onacold Friday evening in February. They were sure this one would be aboy,but five girls were mighty nice and precious. A loft was built overoneend of the log cabin where Reil, Bertha, and Mary slept.</p>

  <p>The girls climbed a ladder to the loft to get to their bed. Belle andEsther slept in a cradle bed that rolled under their parents bed when notin use during the day.</p>

  <p>A landmark on the farm was a huge, tall, round rock located just a littleway north of the log cabin. It was large enough that five to sixchildren could stand on it at one time. The girls used to go down herewith their dolls and play on the rock or play in the water by it. Therock is still there.</p>

  <p>Several years later they bought another eighty acres to the west. It hada nice house and other buildings on it.</p>

  <p>John W. and Birdie worked long hard hours together , clearing timberandmilking ten cows. Birdie churned butter and took ten one-gallon crocksof butter into Mt. Pleasant to sell every week along with eggs she soldfor five to fifteen cents a dozen. John W. cut trees, worked them upinto cordwood, and delivered the wood nine miles into Mt. Pleasant tosell for fuel.</p>

  <p>In 1913 they sold the farm and bought a grocery and variety store inMorning Sun , Ia. Here again they worked long hours side by side for 28years in this business. They also bought and sold butter, eggs, andtested cream from farmers. Birdie had to have cataract surgery as shewas going blind. They sold the store and retired in 1941.</p>

  <p>Birdie was a member of G.A.R. and attended a National Convention in Ohioone year.</p>

  <p>There were times in their 59 years of life together when shadows veiledthe days but with faith and prayer they made their way.</p>

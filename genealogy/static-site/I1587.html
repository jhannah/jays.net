  <p>He was always a good son and brother, and he will long be mourned forhe was always a good friend and neighbor to all in sickness or trouble.He was always ready to give a helping hand to every one and so he will begreatly missed by all his sorrowing family and friends. He said he wouldsoon be at home, he would soon be in heaven with the angels and he wantedto meet all of his loved ones and friends overly there and said to tellthem all good-bye for him.</p>

  <p>Funeral services were held at Donaldson chapel Saturday at 10:30 a.m.,conducted by the pastor, Rev. J. A . Sinclair, and the remains wereinterred in the M. E. cemetery at Salem.</p>

  <p>Had He asked us, well we know</p>

  <p>We would say, "O spare the blow,"</p>

  <p>Yes with streaming tears should pray</p>

  <p>"Lord we love him, let him stay."</p>

  <p>In love he lived, in peace he died,</p>

  <p>His life was asked, but God denied.</p>

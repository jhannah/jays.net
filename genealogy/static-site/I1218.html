  <p>There's a lone little grave on the hillside</p>
  <p>O'er which has no blossom yet blown;</p>
  <p>Upon it the first snow is falling</p>
  <p>And around it the winter winds moan.</p>
  <p>There's a dear little chair by the fire side</p>
  <p>That vacant will be evermore.</p>
  <p>There's a box laid aside full of playthings,</p>
  <p>That will never more litter the floor.</p>
  <p>There's one more little angel in heaven.-</p>
  <p>( How selfish I am to complain!)</p>
  <p>I have one little lamb safely folded</p>
  <p>Away from earth's sorrow and pain.</p>
  <p>Oh, heart that is empty, and aching</p>
  <p>For the little one under the sod,</p>
  <p>Held fast to these sweet words of comfort,</p>
  <p>"Of such is the Kingdom of God."</p>

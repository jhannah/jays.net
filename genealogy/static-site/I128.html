  <p>Obituary Parke County Indiana ca March 25, 1906 the researcher didn'tgive me an exact date or paper on this one.</p>

  <p>John Starks, after several years of patient suffering withrerumatism, quietly passed from the scenes of earth near Parkville, March22, 1906. He was born in Greene township on a farm just one-half milewest of the Mt Moriah Baptist Church, December 17, 1831, being 74 years,3 months and 5 days old. He was reared on the farm of his birth, andduring early life enjoyed the comforts and privileges of other countryboys. Some of the noble characteristics of his life were, that of beingquiet, reserved and unassuming, firm in his convictions of right, butnever indulged in controversy, never meddled in the affairs of others. OnDecember 17, 1857, the day he was 26 years old, he was married to MissElizabeth Connelly, who survives him. To them were born four children,William, Alvah, Mrs Mary Livengood and Mrs Claude Ensey, all of whom areyet living and 11 grandchildren, also two brothers and a sister mourntheir loss--Alex and James and Mrs Sarah Alexander, the latter living inIllinois. For nearly two decades Mr Starks has been unable to do manuallabor, almost the entire time being confined to his bed, sitting in hisinvalid chair and when his friends visited him he always greeted themwith a cheerful smile and would talk intelligently of the current eventsof the day. He indulged a grounded hope of heaven, was a believer in thedoctrines as taught by the Predestinarian Baptists, but never identifiedhimself with the church. His last extreme sufferings were of shortduration, and when the tragical hour came, the wife and children gatheredaround his couch with deep expressions of grief, and when it was seenthat life was ebbing away the family united in calling for prayer, andduring the short invocation the redeemed spirit of the dying man waswafted to its eternal home.</p>

  <p>The funeral services were held from the Mt Moriah church onSaturday, attended by a large concourse of relatives and friends, JohnConnelly of Hume, Ill., being present. A H Dooley read theobituarysupplementing it with remarks on the patient life and characterof the deceased, followed with an appropriate sermon by Elder C Airhart;when the casket was opened the last view of the lifeless features weretaken by all present, then the remains were laid to rest in the cemeterynear by to await the morning of eternity.</p>

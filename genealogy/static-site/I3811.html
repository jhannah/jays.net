  <p>Charles Matthew Trueblood, only child of William D. and Lydia MaxwellTrueblood, was born Dec. 27, 1869 and passed through death's portalsintoGod's other room February 14, 1938, age 68 years, 1 month and 18 days.</p>

  <p>It is of peculiar interest to note that his coronation day came onthesame day as that of his father, who died February 4, 1929, his motherhaving preceded them in November 1920. As a babe he opened his eyesonthe beauties of this world on the farm now occupied by J. R. Savage,onemile south of Cedar Creek church. Later he went with his parents tothepresent homestead where he lived a useful and exemplary life for 68consecutive years.</p>

  <p>On December 12, 1900, he was united in marriage with Minnie Bogue andto this union were born two children, Verle and Lois, to whom he haseverbeen a faithful husband and loving father.</p>

  <p>He was converted in early life and as a young man he was activelyinterested in the Christian Endeavor society of which he was a chartermember. Throughout life, he retained his birthright membership in theCedar Creek Friends church, in which church he served as treasurer for 30years. He was a successful business man, highly esteemed by his businessassociates. He ahs filled many places of trust in both church andcommunity and has ever been found faithful and worthy of confidenceplaced in him by his friends and neighbors. Patience was one of hisfinest characteristics and perhaps nowhere was this revealed so muchasin his last days of suffering when he gave humble obedience to thenurse's suggestions and tender ministrations of his devoted loved ones.</p>

  <p>He is survived by his faithful wife, his son Verle B. Trueblood ofWaterloo, his daughter, Mrs. Lois Hallowell and two grandchildren, Keithand Zelda Mary Hallowell of the Cedar Creek community and a host ofrelatives and friends mourn the loss of this quiet kindly an, who inhisunassuming way sensed a situation and lent a helping hand to all.</p>

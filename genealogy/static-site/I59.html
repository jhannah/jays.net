  <p>Hiram Sylvester or as his many friends knew him, "Hi," was the one childof Henry Harrison and Sarah Elizabeth Stark. He was born on a farm westof this city and all of his life was spent in Jefferson County, in orjust west ofFairfield. For the past 42 years he has resided on the farmwhere he passed away at 1:30 a.m. Monday morning of last week. He wasmarried on January 1, 1884 to Elizabeth Schlief and lived happily inthisunion for overly 50 years. Eight children were born to them, all ofwhom survive excepting Willie who died in infancy. The survivingrelatives are, his sorrowing wife, his seven children, Mrs. Charles Hidyof Batavia, Ia., Mrs Loren Six of Fairfield, Mrs. JessLouth ofLibertyville, Sylvester of Batavia, Henry of Salem, Mrs. Howard Ratcliffof Des Moines, and Loren of Fairfield. Besides these there are 23grandchildren and five great grandchildren and a large number ofrelatives and friendswho will mourn his passing. Mr Stark has been an'Odd Fellow' for the past 35 years and served honorably in the offices ofthe order. His end was very unexpected, he being ill but three hours,and his going was a shock to his manyrelatives and friends. He was agood father and husband, upright and honest in all of his dealings,kindly and sincere in his life, loved and respected by his friends andhis neighbors. His friendliness and thoughtfulness have madea verygreat place for him in the hearts of his many friends. Funeralservices were held at the Hoskins Funeral Home on Wednesday afternoon,conducted by Rev. S. P. Williamson of the First Christian church. Thetwo vocal numbers,"Going Down the Valley" and his favorite hymn "TheSweet Bye and Bye," were beautifully sung by Miss Marie Scott and MauriceLong with Mrs. Gus Scott at the piano. Pall bearers were members of theI.O.O.F. and the ritual of Order wascarried out at the graveside withWilliam Phipps as acting Noble Grand and S.P. Williamson as Chaplain. Theremains were interred in Evergreen cemetery.</p>

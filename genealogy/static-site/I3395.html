  <p>The son of Lindley and Esther Ann Joy, Reuben Folger, was born Jan. 18,1869, at Salem ,Iowa, and passed away Sept. 20, 1932 at Hays, Kas., atthe age of 63 years, 8 mon, and 2 days. In his boyhood he attended thepublic schools of Salem and later Whittier college, a school in Salemmaintained by the Quakers. In these schools and in a Quaker home hereceived his early education. His Quaker ancestry made him a birthrightmember of the Society of Friends.</p>

  <p>He learned the carpenter trade at which he worked along with his fatherduring those early years.</p>

  <p>In 1892 Mr. Joy came to Kansas, and her he was married, March 30, 1895,in Hays, to Miss Elizabeth McIntosh. Over the greater part of the periodsince that time he was teacher in the public schools, combining in lateryears that vocation with farming. In 1925 he removed with his familyform the farm to the city of Hays where he continued to reside untilthetime of his death.</p>

  <p>About six years ago ill health finally forced his retirement fromactive service. Mr. Joy had a good memory, was fond of reading, wellinformed regarding current events, retained his intellectual interests tothe last, and all this together with his devotion to his excellent familyof children and grandchildren helped alleviate the years of invalidism.Many old friends and former pupils, as well as his immediate family willcherish his memory.</p>

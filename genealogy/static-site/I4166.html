  <h2>Notes</h2>
  <p>â€"Compiled by James Bradley Hannah, 19 APRIL 2023 and updated 7 MAY 2024.</p>
  <p>Alexander Hannay (cited as Alexander Ahanna by some) is credited with construction of Sorbie Tower, a fortified tower house in the village of Sorbie, near Wigtown, Scotland. Known as "The Old Place of Sorbie," its constructionaround 1550 is believed to be in response to the murder of Alexander's father, Patrick. This was a time of much strife between the Scottish clans, and in 1601 the Hannas were "put to the horn" (outlawed) for their transgressionsagainst the Murrays. As a result, many of the Hanna clan immigrated to northern Ireland to work in the Ulster plantations beginning at that time. (Source: geneaology@peradura.net). 65.</p>

  <p>The many friends and relatives of William K. Bunker were saddened tolearn of his death which occurred at his home in Salem on May 2nd, 1932at the age of 81 years, 6 mon. and 22 days.</p>

  <p>He was united in marriage to Rosella Canady, Sept. 25, 1873. To thisunion were given seven children, three girls and four boys, one girlpreceding in death; the other six children and nine grandchildren withtheir mother survive. The children are: Clarence, Albert, Florence, Clydeand Elsie, all of Salem and Charles of Stockport. All were with himandministered to him in his last sickness.</p>

  <p>He will be greatly missed in the home and community. His going leavesin the hearts of those who remain an aching void not easily filled, butthe influence of his life in the home and elsewhere will abide.</p>

  <p>Mr. Bunker being a pioneer of early days necessitated a continuation ofthe hard times that old settlers had to undergo but the frontier life didnot discourage his spirits but built character.

  <p>RAGSDALE, Joseph 35 1609-16-1826</p>

  <p>RATGSDALE, Richard 35 24011-10-1826</p>

  <p>The following information is from Terri Ragsdale, who wrote a book called" The Ancestral Heritage of Clarence Wilbur Ragsdale".</p>

  <p>"Our Richard was born about 1765 in St. James Parish, Lunenburg County,</p>

  <p>Virginia. (There was another Richard born the same time who I also didsome</p>

  <p>research on. I wanted to make sure I was working on the right Richard&amp;excl;)This</p>

  <p>other Richard married a Susanna Allen, moved to Georgia, and was the sonof</p>

  <p>Peter Ragsdale. It didn't take long to rule him out as being our Richard.</p>

  <p>Then I started tracing our Richard and his many moves. Richard marriedRebecca</p>

  <p>Pollard in Nov. of 1785. (Surr. on this marriage was Wm. Burchett)</p>

  <p>Rebecca was born in Cumberland Parish, Lunenburg</p>

  <p>County, VA. Richard purchased a piece of land in Lunenburg County in 1791,</p>

  <p>which he later sold to his brother Drury in 1792. (Drury later sold thisland</p>

  <p>himself and moved to Kentucky.) I believe Richard may have purchased thisland</p>

  <p>with with an inheritance from his father, but this is not proven. Thisland was</p>

  <p>purchased from John Norris, Sr. and it ran alongside the "Burchett's"property</p>

  <p>line. Richard's sister, Ann, married a Burchett.(She married YoungBurchett, brother of William who was surr. on marriage)</p>

  <p>Now, when Richard sold the land to his brother, Drury, it was interestingto</p>

  <p>note the people who signed the deed. Alexander Lester signed and hemarried</p>

  <p>Richard's sister, Mary. Elisha Pollard signed it and he was Rebecca'sbrother.</p>

  <p>Also a George Clarke signed it. He was the executor of Joseph Ragsdale'swill.</p>

  <p>Joseph is Richard's father. Also, the description of the property was</p>

  <p>interesting. The description of the property lines in the deed are statedas</p>

  <p>follows:</p>

  <p>"Land lying in Lunenburg County on the Waters of Meherrin River, andcontaining</p>

  <p>one hundred and eighteen acres more or less, bounded as follows Vis,Beginning</p>

  <p>at Robert Scotts line, on a branch of Meherrin River thence along Scottsline to</p>

  <p>Henry Pollards line, thence along Pollard's line to E___ Burchetts line,thence</p>

  <p>along Burchetts line to George Clarks line; thence along Clarks line tothe</p>

  <p>first station;"</p>

  <p>So here we have quite an interesting connection of people. We have nowtied</p>

  <p>Richard's land in with Henry Pollard as well as George Clark. We havealso tied</p>

  <p>in Robert Scott, who married Richard's sister, Jane Ragsdale. We also have</p>

  <p>Burchetts as neighbors who married Richard's sister, Ann.</p>

  <p>Now, in 1793 Richard and Rebecca moved to Madison County, KY. He is foundon</p>

  <p>the tax lists between the years of 1793-1798. This is where my Drury wasborn.</p>

  <p>In 1799 Richard moved his family to Shelby County, KY where he purchasedmore</p>

  <p>land. Rebecca died between 1802-05 in Kentucky. In 1805 Richard marriedMartha</p>

  <p>McDowell.</p>

  <p>Like you, I found records on the Pollard's that shows Henry Pollardselling his</p>

  <p>property in 1793 and moving to Madison County, KY - the same time Richardand</p>

  <p>Rebecca moved. This was probably the land neighboring Richard's land in</p>

  <p>Lunenburg County, VA.</p>

  <p>Richard is found in the personal property tax books in Shelby County, KYbetween</p>

  <p>the years 1799-1801. The year 1802 was not legible. Henry County wasformed</p>

  <p>from Shelby County in 1799 and Richard shows up in the Henry Countypersonal</p>

  <p>property tax books between 1804-1823.</p>

  <p>The 1810 Henry County, KY census lists Richard as follows:</p>

  <p>3 Free While Males age 10-16</p>

  <p>1 Free White Male age 26-45</p>

  <p>2 Free White Females under age 10</p>

  <p>2 Free White Females age 10-16</p>

  <p>1 Free White Female age 26-45</p>

  <p>In 1824 a part of Henry County, KY becomes Oldham County and Richardshows up in</p>

  <p>those personal property tax books in 1824 and 1825. In 1826 Richard soldhis</p>

  <p>land to Joseph Fible for $1,414 and moved to Indiana.</p>

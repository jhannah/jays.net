  <h2>Notes</h2>

  <p>Compiled by James Bradley Hannah, 19 APRIL 2023 and updated 7 MAY 2024:</p>

  <p>Nicknamed Ben or Bennie, Benjamin was the youngest of six children born to John Robert and Zylpha Alzada (Byers) while living at "the Hannah farm" south of Mt. Pleasant, Iowa on "old Highway 218." Friends and family recall him as tall and slender, fun-loving, and athletic. His high school report cards with grades of mostly As and Bs was consistent with his great love of reading. He married Luella Jean Long on her 19th birthday, September 30, 1923. Tragically, he suffered an early death, as recorded in the Mt. Pleasant News under the headline, "Large Crowd Attends Service For Ben Hannah," reading in part:</p>

  <p>Friends, relatives, and sympathetic acquaintances completely filled the First Methodist Church [roughly 300 persons] for the memorial service for Benjamin Millard Hannah, truck driver from Mt. Pleasant who lost his life when the gasoline transport he was driving was involved in a crash nine miles north of Fairfield, in the fog Monday morning... (He) was born November 29, 1920, in Henry County, Iowa. He lost his life February 19, 1951 at the age of thirty years, two months, and twenty days. Surviving him are his wife, the former Jean Long; three small sons, Johnny, Steven, and Jimmie; his mother, Zylpha Hannah; and four sisters, Mrs. Hamilton Williams, Mt. Pleasant; Mrs. Dale Cammack, Salem; Mrs. Fred Perrenoud, Winfield; and Mrs. C.A. Hoffman, Minot, N. Dak. His father and a brother, Wayne, preceded him in death, the latter losing his life in a Pennsylvania plane crash, July 4. 1944.</p>

  <p>The community was shocked and deeply grieved to learn of the car-truck collision that claimed the life of Ben Hannah, 30 of Mt. Pleasant, former resident of Salem community. Ben was well known here and had a host of friends in Salem and community.</p>

Three cars and a truck were involved in an earlier accident, a 2nd truck had been flagged down by the scene. No one was seriously injured in this collision. Hannah came upon the scene of the crash from the south, the road was blocked by the wreckage. Hannah crashed into the truck head-on and was killed instantly in the impending collision, it was mid-morning before the driver was identified as Hannah. It took rescue workers several hours to remove the body from the cab.</p>

  <p>Hannah was driving an oil transport for the Ardery Oil Co. of Mount Pleasant. He had been employed more than a year by this firm. Ben had previously resided on a farm northeast of Salem.</p>

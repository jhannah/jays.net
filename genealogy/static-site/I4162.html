  <h2>Notes</h2>

  <p>&acirc;&euro;"Compiled by James Bradley Hannah, 19 APRIL 2023 and updated 7 MAY 2024.</p>

  <p>Alexander was the Hanna family member who emigrated from Scotland to Ireland. The mid-1600s were a time of civil and religious war in England, Scotland, and Ireland. After an Irish rebellion, England confiscated some million arable acres in northern Ireland for colonies of settlers known as "plantations"&acirc;&euro;"the largest being in Ulster, where Alexander Hanna immigrated. Only English-speaking Protestants were allowed to colonize there. Catholic locals were moved to less-productive areas, setting the stage for later conflicts (e.g. "the troubles" of late 1960s to 1998). Most Scottish settlers were lowland Presbyterians. In the 1660s, the likely era when Alexander arrived in Ulster, Scottish Presbyterians made up some 20% of Ulster's population. But a large wave of Scottish immigration to Ulster took place in the 1690s, when tens of thousands of Scots fled&Acirc;&nbsp;a famine (1696&acirc;&euro;"1698)&Acirc;&nbsp;in the border region of Scotland. It was at this point that Scottish Presbyterians became the majority community in the province... By 1720 they were an absolute majority in Ulster, with up to 50,000 having arrived during the period 1690&acirc;&euro;"1710." (Wikipedia, "Plantation of Ulster).</p>

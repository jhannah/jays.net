Salem News 2-21-1901<br>OBITUARY<br>Henry Scarborough, a son of Lewis and Sarah Scarborough, was born atLowell, Henry county, Iowa, August 26, 1872, and died Feb. 15, 1901 atthe home of his aunt, Mrs. Charity McVey. Mr. Scarborough was a brightyoung man who soughtfor good society with which to mingle. Some yearsago he became a member of the Odd Fellows Lodge in Illinois, and when hecame into the vicinity of Salem, sick , it was soon known by the OddFellows lodge here. And surely the lodgeof Salem have acted the part ofthe good Samaritan to their Brother though he was not a member of thelodge here. For they went and searched him out and visited him fromtimeto time, and ministered very tenderly to his needs andassisted in givinghim a respectable, and beautiful burial.<br>Mr. Scarborough was a believer in christianity and the church, but notuntil his last sickness did he give himself up to God, and take Christ ashis savior from sin, and with him in heaven and we on earth, we rejoicetogether overly hisglorious victory overly sin and Satan. For we believethat he has gone home to heaven to be forever with the Lord.<br>J.A .

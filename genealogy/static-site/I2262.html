  <p>---o---</p>

  <p>"While greasing the curve of the street railroad tracks at the corner ofWard and Keota streets this morning William Boyles, aged 49, residing at309 Park avenue, a veteran employee of the company, dropped dead. It isthought that his death was caused by heart failure although he had neversuffered from the disease. In fact Mr. Boyles had not been ill since amere boy. His death occurred about 8:45 o'clock and Marion Smith, arural mail carrier, and Lawrence Moss were the first to reach the deadman. An examination by physicians revealed the fact that life wasextinct, although the body was still warm. The remains were removedto the office of the street car company where physicians again made anexamination.</p>

  <p>Wife Becomes Hysterical.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Boyles was immediately communicated with and when she arrivedathe office and saw the remains of her husband, she immediately becamehysterical. Frantic cries to him to come back to life touched the heartsof all who heard them. For a time the bereaved woman would not allow thephysicians to touch the body. The remains were later removed to theC.T. Sullivan morgue and prepared for burial. Coroner A. W. Slaught wassummoned. He will hold an inquest tonight at 7 o'clock at which time aneffort will be made to learn the cause of death.</p>

  <p>Mr. Boyles had greased one side of the curve and was starting to workon the other track. The Ward street car passed while he was at workandhe waved his hand at the motorman and conductor. When the car gotten twoblocks away, the men on the rear platform saw Mr. Boyles throw up hishands and fall backward to the ground. Smith and Moss rushed to hisassistance but death had been instantaneous.</p>

  <p>Was Veteran Employee.</p>

  <p>The deceased was a veteran employee of the Ottumwa Railway &amp; Lightcompany, having been in their employ for nine years. He had the care ofthe tracks. He was a familiar figure to men who never knew him by anyother name than "Bill." He always called the cars on circus and on baseball days and his long connection with the company made him well known tohundreds of Ottumwans. He was of a good disposition and numbered hisfriends by the legion. The news of his death came as a great shock tohis co-workers and to his numerous friends.</p>

  <p>Worked for Burlington.</p>

  <p>The deceased formerly resided at Mt. Pleasant and had a host of friendsand relatives there. For many years he was baggage man for theBurlington at the Ottumwa station and he also worked in other capacitiesfor the railroad. He is survived by his wife and one daughter, MissGladys Boyles. Following his sudden death this morning, the report wascirculated about the city that he had been electrocuted but this reportwas denied by the company officials who inspected the tracks at thescene of his death. It is the general belief that heart failure causedhis death.</p>

About midnight she summoned the family and requested hersister to sing for her. That she was very happy and desired to leavethis world before the dawn of day so she could join her mother on theother shore were enthusiastic expressions of hers. Her mother died aboutfive years ago, after which Ina, with her sisters, strove to fill thevacant place and comfort their dear father by assuming full charge of thehousehold cares. They met with splendid success in this and receivedmany words of praise.

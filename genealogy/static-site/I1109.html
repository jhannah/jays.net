Three sons and one daughterremain to comfort the bereaved mother; Guy J., Melvin M., Forest L.,andEunice E. He is also survived by his father, one brother and twosisters. For two years his health has been gradually failing and hissuffering has been great, but he bore it patiently. All had been donethat could be, and his death had been expected for some time. He hadheart trouble so bad that he could not lie down, but slept in his chair.He had been better for several days which made his death seem sudden,being found by his wife in his chair, asleep as it were, about 4 o'clockin the morning when she came in his room to build up the fire. She hadbeen up often during the night and he seemed as well as usual. He was akind and affectionate husband and father and his loss will be greatlyfelt in this vicinity as none knew him but to love him. Rev. Robertssaid he was one of the best men he ever knew.</p>

  <p>The funeral services took place at the family residence .... Rev.W.W. Roberts, of Mt. Pleasant, he being a favorite friend of the deceased.The text, chosen by the wife, was Matt. 24:42; "Watch therefor, for yeknow not what hour your Lord doth come." The singing was led by Mrs. W.W. Roberts and daughter. The first song "Shall we gather at the river."was a favorite of the deceased. The pall bearers were his nephews, R. E.Hoyt, Lin Byers. Milton Knight, Fred Knight, George Bunker, and HenryScarborough. The remains were laid to rest in the M. E. cemetery.</p>

  <p>The eyes that ached with pain so long,</p>

  <p>Had peacefully fell asleep.</p>

  <p>The lips had left a pleasant smile,</p>

  <p>That told us all was peace.</p>

  <p>A chair is vacant in the house,</p>

  <p>That never can be filled;</p>

  <p>But we must think that all is right,</p>

  <p>For it as Thou has't willed.</p>

  <p>R. C. S.</p>

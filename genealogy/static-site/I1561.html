  <p>OBITUARY OF MRS. HOCKETT</p>

  <p>Abigil Jane Hockett, the subject of this notice, was born Feb. 10 th,1844, near Richmond, Ind. Her maiden name was Macy. She came with herparents to Iowa in 1856, settling near Salem, in Henry count; was marriedto Nathan H. Hockett May 23d, 1867; died Oct. 31 st, 1899 at their home,near Salem, where they had lived for overly 30 years. She leaves besidesher husband and three children, a large circle of relatives and friendsto mourn her loss, but they sorrow not, as those who have no hope, forshe died in the full assurance of a victorious faith in Jesus Christasher personal savior. She was converted to Christ at the age of 19, andfor several of the last years of her life was not only an active memberof the church, but a firm believer in the doctrine, and a witness totheexperience of that perfect love, that casteth out fear; hence when shecame down to the valley of the shadow of death she feared o evil, andduring her most intense suffering she said, in the language of the poet:</p>

  <p>"Jesus can make a dying bed</p>

  <p>Soft as downy pillows are."</p>

  <p>In her experience God's promise of peace was wonderfully verified, Psalms37-37; Mark the perfect man and behold the upright for the end of thatman is peace. The funeral services were held at her home church atOakland Mills, and in the presence of a large and truly sympatheticcongregation. She was laid to rest in the cemetery at that place toawait the resurrection of the just.</p>

  <p>HAYS WOMAN LIVES ON</p>

  <p>SITE OF OLD ROME</p>

  <p>---</p>

  <p>Mrs. J. H. O'Loughlin, With Parents,</p>

  <p>Occupies House One Mile West</p>

  <p>Of Hays in 1879</p>

  <p>---</p>

  <p>(By Mrs. J. H. O'Loughlin)</p>

  <p>I spent my ninth birthday, April 1, 1879 in a covered wagon en routefrom Coon Rapids, Iowa, to Ellis County, Kansas. My father had soldoffall of his farming equipment a few days before and rigged up a wagonwitha canvas cover and painted it on the side with big red letters, "Kansasor Bust." My Mother's two brothers fitted up their wagons in a similarfashion and made the trip with us. Our kitchen table was turned upsidedown and used for a bed for my younger sister. Our family was composedof five children, three girls and two boys, ranging in age from elevenyears to one year. Our parents and my brothers and sisters all slept inthe covered wagon at night, but we cooked and ate our meals along theroadside. When we crossed the Missouri river at Nebraska City, fatherdrove the team and wagon onto a ferry boat and we children were verymuchfrightened. Father kept talking to his team, as they gotten excited andtried to jump overly the railing into the water.</p>

  <p>When we reached Sterling, Nebraska, a sad accident occurred. My littlecousin, who was about two years old pulled overly the coffee pot whilemyaunt was preparing dinner and scalded her head and arms so badly that shedied within a few hours. We buried the little one the next day atSterling and proceeded on our way, but we had lost the high spirits anddisposition for fun-making with which we had started the trip.</p>

  <p>We often stopped at the little towns along the way to buy some suppliesand make inquiries about the road. The settlers laughed when they sawthe sign on the wagon and said it would be "bust' when we did get toKansas.</p>

  <p>Arrived at Rome</p>

  <p>At Osborn, Kansas, my father bought a cow which we tied to the wagon.In a few days, (April 20, 1879) we landed in Ellis County, Kansas,without seeing any of the Indians that we had heard so much about. Wetraveled along Big Creek and finally drove across a big dam which welater found supplied the water power for operating I. M. Yost's flourmill in Hays. We landed at a place on the south side of Big Creek, abouta mile west of Hays, which was called Rome. This site had formerly hadbeen an Indian village and was later occupied as a railroad camp. Howeverwhen we arrived the only trace of the former occupancy was a large stonehouse with two long rooms, a small stable and a small mound in the frontyard which was covered with little shells and beads of every color.</p>

  <p>Our family lived in the big house which was about opposite the placewhere the railroad bridge west of Hays is now located. Our only neighborwas a Mr. Strosser, who lived in the small dug out in the south bankofthe creek in which he operated a brewery.</p>

  <p>We were very much disappointed when we did not see the buffalo, thedeer and the antelope which were reported to be so abundant in this wildcountry. However, within a few days we were rewarded with the sightof areal live buffalo, but it was already in captivity and was being ledatthe end of a rope. We later saw large herds of deer and antelope alongthe Saline river and often had venison and antelope meat to feast on.</p>

  <p>The numerous buffalo wallows on the prairies were probably theinspiration for the following lines which I have clipped from someforgotten source.</p>

  <p>" The Kansas Dust"</p>

  <p>---</p>

  <p>"Out of the dust of Kansas,</p>

  <p>In old primeval days;</p>

  <p>Out of the shroud of a drifting cloud,</p>

  <p>Across its grassy ways.</p>

  <p>Flaunting the flag of the prairie dust</p>

  <p>The shaggy bison's graze.</p>

  <p>Over a landscape red with rust</p>

  <p>The herds emerge from the Kansas dust"</p>

  <p>Hair Curlers from Bullets</p>

  <p>We lived close to the military reservation and could watch the soldiersat drill and target practice. We used to go overly and pick up thebullets. My brothers used them in their guns but my sisters and I placedthem upon the railroad track and let the train flatten them out so wecould use them for hair curlers. The soldiers cut ice in the Big Creekand often came to our house to get warm. They told us about their longhikes with their knapsacks on their backs. We often saw them as theywalked overly to Plainville and back.</p>

  <p>I still remember a little incident which happened soon after wearrived. One of my cousins was exhausted when her returned from fishingin Big Creek and laid down between the railroad tracks and went tosleep. The trains ran very infrequently, but a train happened to comealong soon after and had almost passed overly the boy before the engineerdiscovered him. The bell on the engine awakened the sleeping youngsterand he jumped up just in time to see a colored porter who was runningdown the track to see if he was hurt. My cousin was so frightened at thesight of the negro, that he ran all the way home, where we were all outin the front yard wondering why the train had stopped and why the bellwas clanging.</p>

  <p>We spent hours picking the little fine Indian beads out of the dirt andmaking long strands to wear. We often saw arrow heads which wecollected. In those early days the prairies were infested with manypests and reptiles. A large spider known as the tarantula often invadedour house. Centipedes, water-puppies, lizards and horny toads were alsonumerous. When we went swimming we saw bull snakes, water snakes, andblue racers.</p>

  <p>We saw some hard times during those first few years, and lived mostlyon corn bread and sorghum molasses. Sometimes we did not even have themolasses and mother made us a gravy flavored with vinegar which we called"hard times." We did not have any milk as the cow we purchased atOsborne died a few days after we reached our destination.</p>

  <p>Lived in Sod House</p>

  <p>The spring following our arrival at Rome, we moved about nine milesnorth of Hays and my father ran a breaking plow to turn up the sod forour house. We had a two room "soddy" which was very warm in winter andcool in summer. Father also built a sod stable for he horses and acoopfor the few chickens which he had bought. A new pest now appeared in thesod house, namely: fleas, but we discovered that a layer of milk weeds onthe bed springs kept them away from us at night.</p>

  <p>At first we were confronted with the problem of getting water forourselves and the livestock as the first well my father dug was dry. Aman who traveled about "witching" for water came and tested theprospective locations with a peach tree limb. A well was dug at theplace he detected and was found to contain an abundant supply of water.</p>

  <p>We had just settled in our new home when a prairie fire threatenedtodestroy everything. The sparks from a train started a fire a few mileseast of Hays. A high wind was blowing and within a few hours it wasraging near our home. Our folks had gone to Hays and we were franticwith fear, so we lowered a ladder into the dry well and climbed down. Thewind soon changed and the fire guards which the neighbors had plowedkeptthe fire from approaching any nearer.</p>

  <p>During the first year in our new home my father made a little moneyselling red cedar wood which he cut and hauled from along the Salineriver. We also helped him gather up bones of wild animals which weresold in Hays. We also sold wild plums, grapes, choke cherries, hillcherries, currents and elderberries which we gathered along the creek.</p>

  <p>Planting Under Difficulties</p>

  <p>We prepared the soil for planting with a breaking plow and then used anax of hatchet to make a hole in the sod, then dropped the seed and closedthe hole with our heels. The ground squirrels gotten part of our seed butwe had very good crops the first year. The next year we ran the sodcutter overly this ground, harrowed it, and seeded it with wheat.</p>

  <p>During the winter of 1881 and 1882 we lived in Hays so that my olderbrother could go to school. Mrs. Tom Gartland was his teacher.</p>

  <p>During that winter a colored regiment was stationed at Fort Hays. Oneafternoon a quarrel started in a saloon in Hays between some of thecitizens and several of the colored soldiers. The colored soldiersreturned in the evening and threatened to burn the whole town and killthe marshal. Charlie Bason, who was the marshal, hid under the platformof the depot while the troops were looking for him. We lived in thefirst house north of the Catholic church. During the evening we sawablaze, but were afraid to go out as the colored soldiers had threatenedto kill anyone who appeared to put out the flames. The first houseburned was a block south of the railroad track and the fire continued tospread until nearly the whole block was destroyed. One brave citizen ranalong Big Creek to the old fair grounds and swam across and gave thealarm to the captain. This officer immediately mounted his horse andcame overly and lined up the colored troops and marched them back to thefort. Within a few days they were shipped out of town. But theprejudice against the colored people continued to run high and all of thecolored inhabitants were forced to leave town at once. This resentmentagainst the negroes continues to this day and it is not safe for a man ofthe darker hue to let the sun set on his head in the city of Hays.</p>

  <p>In the spring of 1882 we moved back to the farm and my father had asorghum mill shipped out from our old home in Iowa. The neighbors nearCatherine sold cane to us and we made molasses to sell. Our foodsupplies were low that winter and the boys would often throw pitchforksat the snowbirds that gathered around the millet stacks and kill them bythe dozen for pot pie.</p>

  <p>The prairie dogs were thick on our place and we had to drown them out.The prairie dogs, owls and both the black and gray rattlesnakes all livedin the same holes. We occasionally saw a beaver, a wild cat, an opposumor a badger. And one day my parents saw a mountain lion which was killedlater three miles from our place. My uncles had two pet antelopes whichthey fed on father's cabbage and tomatoes. One of them gotten cross andbunted us overly.</p>

  <p>Our chief amusements were horse back riding, dancing, and taffy pulls.We often gathered up a party of old and young people in a lumber wagonand went twenty miles across the prairie to a dance. There were notroads or trails to follow and we sometimes gotten lost. All of the peoplewere very hospitable and strangers were always welcome and made to feelat home.</p>

  <p>School Organized</p>

  <p>During the fall of 1883 Anna Rasmussen taught a three months school inmy uncle's house. The next year District No. 41 was organized and anewschool house was built. The first teacher was William Thorp.</p>

  <p>The winter of 1886 was the hardest we ever experienced n Kansas. Thesnow fell for three days and nights and no one could get out of the housebecause of the high snow-drifts. One of our neighbors lost two hundredhead of cattle in the storm and several people along the Saline riverfroze to death. The wood supply had been almost exhausted during theprevious winter and the people were then burning cow chips which they hadstored during the fall.</p>

  <p>The next winter some ranchers in Texas brought their long horned cattleto graze on the Kansas plains. The cowboys who accompanied them were ahard lot and they often drove the cattle onto our farms at night to eatup the feed, and if the farmer or his dog interfered their lives were indanger.</p>

  <p>Some one has said that the real pioneer in Kansas didn't wear anyunderwear, but this was not true of the Ellis county pioneer and theclothes lines with undergarments advertising I. M. Yost's High Patentflour were the best evidence.</p>

  <p>Not everyone in Western Kansas was poor in those early days and some ofthe prosperous newcomers in 1876 were German-Russians who started thesettlements at Catherine, Munjor, Herzog and other points near Hays.Theyliked to work and had good farms which were well cared for. Some ofthemwith large families were not comfortably fixed and their children workedout as soon as they were old enough.</p>

  <p>Early Day Wedding</p>

  <p>In 1881 when Charley Howard was sheriff, a girl by the name of BarbaraCorbey came from Munjor to do house work for his family. Her familywereGerman-Russians and were well known in Hays. When Barbara was marriedshe had a big wedding celebration at her home in Munjor and most of Hayspeople were invited. The bride wore a changeable green silk dress whichMrs. Howard had brought back from Germany and which she had folded into abustle when she came through the customs. The parish priest was calledaway, so the wedding festivities continued for five days until theceremony was performed. Several beeves had been butchered for theoccasion and a special table with fancy cakes and decorations was set forthe Hays people. The bride and her family had a separate table with alarge bowl of soup and meat in the center from which all were served.The guests took turns eating, drinking and dancing the hochzeit withanoccasional nap at the home of near neighbors. Whiskey was passed aroundafter each dance and the men smoked their long stem pipes, even whilethey were dancing. Every man danced with the bride and greenbacks werepinned all overly her dress by the guests. Many other early settlers inHays will remember other happenings at this wedding celebration.</p>

  <p>The cowboy has followed in the wake of the Indian and the buffalo;fenced fields and cultivated crops have taken the place of the rangeandthe grazing herds of cattle; the tractor has supplanted the horse-drawnplow and the automobile has put the old phaeton and team out ofbusiness. Kansas has kept pace with the march of progress, but we areglad to see remaining that old time hospitality, the kindly greetingtothe stranger at our gates, the good fellowship, sociability andgenerosity which have made us so many friends. Material wealth has itsplace, but let us not forget that the greatest riches of a nation areoften found in the hearts of man.</p>

  <p>McIntosh, James and Cordelia</p>

  <p>James McIntosh was born October 18, 1843 at Bethel, Ohio, to Alexanderand Mary J. (McCollum) McIntosh. After growing up on the family farm,McIntosh enlisted at Bethel on January 24, 1865, in Company I, 184thOhioInfantry, for one years' service.</p>

  <p>Private McIntosh was unused to the southern climate in Alabama andbecame ill. He was sent to the post hospital at Bridgeport on April16.With the surrender of Lee and Johnston, the War Department orderedMcIntosh and all other sick and injured Union soldiers in hospitalsmustered out of service on May 24. Family lore says it was a very sickMcIntosh who managed to make his way from Bridgeport to his home atBethel, Ohio, after his discharge.</p>

  <p>A few years after the war McIntosh moved to Henry County, Iowa, where,in his own words, "we farmed in summer and went to the mines to dig coalin the winter with no prospect of making enough at either to get ahead."This problem became acute for him when he met and married Cordelia ByersApril 18, 1867, and later became a father.</p>

  <p>His wife Cordelia was born June 8, 1846, in Huntington County, Indiana,to John and Mary E. (Daily) Byers. Around 1853 the Byers family movedfrom Indiana to Henry County, Iowa, and settled on a farm six miles eastof Salem. They later moved into the town. It was at Salem that Cordeliamet and married McIntosh.</p>

  <p>McIntosh and his wife were the parents of six children: George William(1868-1961); Mary Ellen O'Loughlin (1870-1938); Ida May Wirtz(1872-1918); John Alexander (1875-1948); Elizabeth "Lizzie" Joy(1877-1948); and Clara Belle Balls (1880-1978).</p>

  <p>The McIntosh family, accompanied by some of the wife's relatives, setout in covered wagons with "Kansas or Bust" painted on the canvas cover.</p>

  <p>McIntosh wrote his account of his arrival in Ellis County for the EllisCounty News (March 28, 1929): "On April 20, 1879, I came to Ellis Countywith my wife, five children and a team and wagon. On arriving at Hays,then known as Hays City, we stopped at Henry Winters' and I receivedthefirst information about the locality. We lived in temporary quarters forseveral months, then settled in Buckeye Township. I built a two-room sodhouse with ridge poles and boards, then sod and dirt for the roof. Therewere windows on two sides and the inside was plastered and white - washedwith natural lime. This house was warm in winter and cool in summerandwe never feared storms when we were inside."</p>

  <p>Further details about the McIntosh family's early experiences in EllisCounty were provided by his daughter Mary E. O'Loughlin in an article inthe News on March 21, 1929, and makes very interesting reading.</p>

  <p>In addition to farming, McIntosh served as postmaster in Bantam inBuckeye Township and, although not a doctor, provided knowledge on homeremedies for the sick.</p>

  <p>After retiring from farming, and with his children married off andmoved away from home, McIntosh and his wife settled in Hays. CordeliaMcIntosh passed away there March28, 1924. McIntosh occupied his timewith membership in the local Grand Army of the Republic organizationandnever missed a parade in town. He died March 5, 1929, and was buried inMount Allen Cemetery next to his wife. The funeral was presided overly bymembers of Hays American Legion Post. submitted by James D. Drees.</p>

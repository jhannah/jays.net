  <p>PICKARD ACQUITTED</p>

  <p>After considering the case for several hours the jury returned averdict of "not guilty' in the case of the state of Iowa vs. DeweyPickard charged with "assault with intention to inflict great bodilyinjury" upon George Willis, the eight year old son of Mr. and Mrs.William Willis of Jackson township, while Pickard was teaching theBushwack school and Willis was a pupil.</p>

  <p>The verdict was no surprise as the evidence failed to show that therewas any attempt to injure the boy in the whipping that he received forstealing and lying.</p>

  <p>The evidence brought out was to the effect that the boy would refuse torecite and had sullen spells when he would not obey the teacher. Mr.Pickard did the best he could and even consulted the parents but to noavail. Finally several articles were missed by the other students and onMarch 2, 1920 some of them were found in the boy's desk and pockets andhe later dug up others in the yard. Pickard then whipped the boy, whoconfessed, remaining in school that afternoon.</p>

  <p>The boy reported the whipping and the parents finding his legs bruisedhad him examined by Mt. Pleasant doctors some neighbors also came in. Thenext day the bruises had turned dark and looked bad but no skin wasbroken or blood flowed.</p>

  <p>The whole question was as to whether the boy was shipped with too greatseverity. The district is reported as bout evenly divided on the subject.</p>

  <p>The case was watched with much interest by school authorities as ifPickard were found guilty teachers would be afraid to use corporalpunishment as they would run the risk of being arrested for assault,witha possibility of five years in the penitentiary.</p>

  <p>We note that John McMasters was on the jury.</p>

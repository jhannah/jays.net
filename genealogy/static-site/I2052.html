  <p>J. E. ROBERTS</p>

  <p>Mt. Pleasant News</p>

  <p>The announcement of the death of Mr. J. E. Roberts, son of Mrs. W.W.Roberts living south of this city, came as a surprise and brought sadnessinto the hearts of his many friends. He was well known here and marrieda Miss Collins of near Salem. The following clipping is taken from aNevada paper and tells of the love and esteem in which the deceased washeld.</p>

  <p>Wells, Nevada, June 8. - A telegram received here about nine o'clockWednesday evening conveyed the information that J. E. Roberts, son ofRev. and Mrs. W. W. Roberts of Mt. Pleasant, Ia., died at Goldfield thatevening shortly after five o'clock. The news was startling, as fewpeople in wells knew that he was even sick. Pneumonia was the causeofdeath.</p>

  <p>The deceased was well known in this vicinity, having resided in thisneighborhood for about fifteen years. Shortly overly a year ago hedisposed of his interests here and removed with his family to Goldfield,where he has been engaged in conducting a lodging house.</p>

  <p>Not long after going to Goldfield, he was stricken with typhoid feverand for a number of days hovered on the brink of eternity. It isprobable that he had not fully recovered from his illness when strickenwith pneumonia.</p>

  <p>J. E. Roberts was a native of Iowa, having been born in Lee county,about sixteen miles from Mt. Pleasant, about 36 years ago. Early inlifehe married the young lady, who now survives him as a widow, and a shorttime thereafter came to wells. From that time until his removal toGoldfield he had lived with his family in Clover and Starr Valleys and onthe U-7 ranch north of Wells. To mourn his untimely demise he leaves inthis state a heart-broken wife and two children of Goldfield; a sister,Miss Minnie Roberts of Starr Valley and an uncle, Dillon Roberts ofClover.</p>

  <p>J. E. Roberts was a whole-souled, energetic, hard-working man, honest,conscientious and reliable. He was a devoted husband and father andwillbe mostly missed by the bereaved widow and children. To them especially,and to the other relatives, the heartfelt sympathy of this communityisextended in their hour of great sorrow. Mere words of sympathy seemtothem as empty mockery in their sad, dark hour, and do little to assuagethe grief that is assailing their hearts, and only the God who has givenand who hath taken away can furnish relief. May He tide them through thedark shadow that now engulfs them, and heal the wounds caused by thehandof death.</p>

  <p>The remains will be transported here for interment and the funeralwilltake place tomorrow.</p>

  <p>The Salem Weekly News May 2 ,1907</p>

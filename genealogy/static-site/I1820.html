  <h2>Notes</h2>

  <p>Salem News June 3,1920</p>

  <p>A regrettable accident occurred Saturday night in which Miss Ruth Sprayhad the misfortune to lose two of her front teeth. She was walking alongthe street when she passed Earth Smith and Tom White, who were engaged ina heated argument. Just as she passed the two, Smith staged a blow atWhite, as we understand it, and the latter dodged, Miss Spray getting thefull force with the result stated. After arrangements had been madetotake her to the dentist, the fight was resumed with no interference bythe authorities. The affair grew out of the war time feud, the immediatecause, we understand, being that Smith charges White with hogging theroad whenever he meets him.</p>

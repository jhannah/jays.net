  <p>Notes from Jon Topp's files:</p>
  <p>Obituary indicates Nov 7, 1841 as birth date. Listed as age 11 in the1850 Census, taken 17 September 1850 in Iowa. The Salem, Iowa Quakermeeting records list the birth date as 7 November 1841 in Henry Co,Iowa. The census ageappears to be inconsistent, requiring an 1838 or1839 year of birth. However, Elizabeth was not mentioned in the transferfrom White River, Indiana to Salem, Iowa in November 1839. She wasprobably born in Iowa. The Salem Quakerrecords and Obituary are givenpreference overly the Census. Moran's Bunker Genealogy gives November17,1841. No other corroberation for this date has been found.</p>

Hello! My name is <a href="http://jays.net/genealogy/Html/I1265.html">Jay Weston Hannah</a>. I'm 
a computer geek currently living in Omaha, NE, USA. 
My homepage is <a href="http://jays.net">http://jays.net</a> and my email address
is &lt;jay(at)jays(dot)net&gt;. 
This is my fault, so I'm your point of contact for additions, corrections, removal, complaints, etc.
<p>

Earlier this year (2005) I was inspired to take up genealogy as a hobby. Mere months later with
much help from genealogy genius relatives of mine, family trees lying about, conversations, 
and lots of data entry I've compiled over 4000 of my relatives into my genealogy database (GEDCOM).
<p>
Enjoy!
<p>

My GEDCOM:
<ul>
<li><a href="Html/people.html">List of people</a>
<li><a href="Html/surnames.html">List of surnames</a>
<li>PDF: <a href="hannah.pdf">Descendants of James C. Hannah</a> (~ 1774)
<li>PDF: <a href="stark.pdf">Descendants of William Stark</a> (~1622)
<li>PDF: <a href="thomson.pdf">Descendants of William C. Thomson</a> (~1705)
</ul>

Some highlights of my GEDCOM:
<ul>
<li>My Great Great Great Great (GGGG) Grandfather Hannah was <a href="http://jays.net/genealogy/Html/I1172.html">James C. Hannah</a>. 
<li>My Grandfather <a href="http://jays.net/genealogy/Html/I1581.html">Earl Chapman Humphrey</a> served in
World War II on the <a href="http://www.usshouston.org/">USS Houston CA-30</a> and was a prisoner
of war for 3 years. He was also great at bouncing me on his knee and I miss him.
<li>My wife Andria's GGGGGGGrandfather was <a href="http://jays.net/genealogy/Html/I4062.html">William C. Thomson</a>. His son <a href="http://jays.net/genealogy/Html/I4089.html">James Thomson</a> was born in 1730
in Ireland.
The Thomson family tree, pictured up and right, has 1500 people on it dating back to 1705ish.
These are my wife's blood relatives, not mine; but the tree is still wicked cool. -grin-
  <ul>
  <li>Also see "Thomson Family History" below. It starts at William. 
  <li>June Sparks (junetsparks(at)cableone(dot)net) says: 
      The original of this tree hangs on the wall in the 
      library of Wabash College, Indiana. The Rev. John Thomson is one of the original founders 
      of the all men's college. He held a meeting in his living room where the 
      founders for Wabash met and put it all together - based on protestant principles.
  </ul>
<li>My GGGGGGGGGrandfather was (probably) 
<a href="http://jays.net/genealogy/Html/I894.html">William Stark</a>, 
born somewhere around 1637.
<li>The Chapman family bible that is currently in my grandmother's possession is an amazing book.
It's huge, like something from a movie set, and contains the family and descendants of
<a href="http://jays.net/genealogy/Html/I3992.html">George Chapman</a>.
<li>When Giberson cousins married Stark siblings they caused a 
<a href="http://jays.net/genealogy/starks_and_gibersons.png">confusing pretzel shaped chart</a>.
<li>My loving family, in all directions, that never fail to support <a href="http://jays.net/genealogy/Html/I1265.html">me</a>. Thanks, all!
</ul>

Software I Use
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.dcs.qmul.ac.uk/~keithc/family-history/see-gedcom/">SeeGECOMX</a> - I do all my editing with this program on my Mac.
<li><a href="http://www.pidcock.co.uk/gth/">gedcomToHTML</a> - Creates this website from my data (written in Perl).
<li><a href="relation_pl.txt">relation.pl</a> - A Perl script that uses Gedcom::LifeLines, a Perl port of a
genealogy scripting language called "LifeLines". (Did I get that right?)
<li><a href="http://search.cpan.org/~pjcj/Gedcom-1.15/Gedcom.pm">Gedcom.pm</a> - Perl module I played around with.
<li><a href="http://www.genopro.com">GenoPro</a> - Makes cool graphs (of a few hundred people max
on my craptastic Win98 PC.
</ul>
